    <h1>Why monkey swings on trees</h1>
  </div>
    <p>There was once a time when monkey did not swing in the trees.
He used to play on the ground and loved to wind nasty crocodile up. When the big rains came to the jungle land, monkey got stranded high up the mango tree. Needing crocodile's help, he promised to give him his heart in exchange for being safely returned to dry land. This made the crocodile more interested since he would have otherwise left monkey for dead after the way he used to rile him up. Crocodile fulfilled his end of the bargain but monkey tricked him by throwing a juicy, red mango instead and running fast on his heels. Crocodile was furious to find out he had been tricked and vowed to get back at monkey for this. From that day on, monkey swings from branch to branch keeping well clear of crocodile's snapping jaws.</p>
