    <h1>Why lion roars</h1>
  </div>
    <p>There was a time when lion had lost his roar, making him loathe himself for what could only be seen as a sign of weakness. At the time, crocodile was snapping at all the animals and scaring most of them away but lion could do nothing about it. It was during one animal gathering that flea happened to mention to the lion that if he dared to enter the great cave of the jungle land, then maybe he would find his roar and quit sulking all the time. Lion had heard about this famous cave but had never dwelled on the idea until that day. He decided to go try his luck since he had nothing to lose by trying his luck. It is then that lion gathered up his courage so as to go confront the great cave, While there, when he roared with all his might, an even bigger roar came back... Lion's very own echo! He had found his roar! From that day on lion always roars with pride, showing any beast that he is the real king of the jungle. </p>
