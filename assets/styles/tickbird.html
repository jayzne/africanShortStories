    <h1>Why tickbird sits on hippo's back</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was a time when the hippo and the tickbird were not friends at all.
Tickbird was fed up to the beak with hippo's splishing and sploshing, which was only what she did after she had lost all her hair to a fire. Then one day tickbird challenged hippo to a contest to test who is the better of the two. The challenge was who would manage to drink the most water in a single gulp! To add insult to injury, tickbird made sure to invite all the other animals to come and witness the competition. Hippo could not believe her ears... Big hippo versus the tiny tickbird was what was on everyone's mind on that day. But little tickbird outwit hippo by cleverly using the tides and the sea coming in and going out. From that day on hippo is not allowed to splosh in the waterhole without permission and tickbird is allowed to sit on Hippo's back and eat all the yummy ticks she can eat!</p>
