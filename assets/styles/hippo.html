    <h1>Why the hippo has no hair</h1>
  </div>
    <p>There was a time when hippo had lots of hair all over her body. So she was always harrumphingly hot and all she did was complan about the heat and wishing that she had no hair, to the disdain of many. All she wanted to do was to splosh in the waterhole, but this was forbidden... water was only meant for fishes in accordance with the royal decree made by their king, the lion. Then one night when hippo was sleeping, a spark from the fire set light to the end of her hairy tail. Hippo was on fire! Luckily, she was near the waterhole and she hurriedly jumped in, her first instinct being to save her hair, the same hair she kept complaining about. sadly for her, when hippo surfaced, she had not even a single strand of hair on her hide. And from that day on hippo is allowed to stay in the cool waters. </p>
