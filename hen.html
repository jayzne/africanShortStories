    <h1>Why hen pecks the ground</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was a time when hen did not peck the ground. She was a proud mother who spent all her time looking after and cleaning her chicks. One day, fancy pancy peacock upset mother hen and made her feel plain. All the animals were furious with snooty peacock but the damage had already been done. Eagle, mother hen's best friend, decided to lend hen her most prized possession, a needle. Mother hen sewed herself the most beautiful coat of new feathers. Everyone was delighted and they danced and danced and danced. But mother hen forgot all about the needle and it got lost in all the dust. She tried to clean up and had to disarrange her furniture, going as far as to even engage the help of her chicks but it was nowhere to be found. From that day on hen always pecks the ground looking for the needle to return to her friend. </p>
