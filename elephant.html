    <h1>Why elephant has a trunk</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was once a time when elephant had no nose. He could not swat away flies, or scrub his belly or even get to pick out the most juicy of leaves from the topmost branches. So he was very pongy indeed. Then one day, snappy crocodile snapped elephant on the end of his stubby nose while he was drinking from the jungle's waterhole and he pulled, and pulled until elephant's nose became all long and wiggly. Elephant took some time adjusting to the new changes and decided to call his new nose a trunk. From that day on he can scrub and swat away the flies and when he blows his new trunk he has the loudest trumpet in all of the jungle land.</p>
