    <h1>Why squirrel gathers nuts</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was once a time when squirrel did not gather nuts. She lived in her burrowed hole and was far too busy braiding her bushy tail all day every day, ignoring her personal chores and royally given duties. A very dry drought hit the jungle one year and there was very little food left to feed the animals since all their saved stock was used up. Lion summoned all the animals to pull together and help find food for everyone, especially since some animals were already weakened and were dying. having hardly eaten anything for days. Squirrel was too busy braiding her tail to join in, but when she finally realised that there was not enough food to go round, she raced around gathering nuts for all the animals. Even to this very day, squirrel runs around gathering nuts.</p>
