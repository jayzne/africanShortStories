    <h1>Why hippo has no hair</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was a time when hippo had lots of hair. So she was always harrumphingly hot and all she did was complain about it to everyone who could listen. All she wanted to do was to splosh in the waterhole, but this was forbidden by king lion's royal decree. The water was for fishes only. Then one night when hippo was sleeping, a spark from the fire set light to the end of her hairy tail and slowly the fire spread all over her hairy body. when hippo woke up she was all on fire, and it was getting closer to burning up her skin. Hippo jumped into the waterhole before it got too late. When hippo surfaced, she had no hair, not a single hair on her hide. And from that day on hippo has been allowed to stay in the cool waters. </p>
