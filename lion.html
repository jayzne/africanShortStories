    <h1>Why lion roars</h1>
  </div>
<p>There was a time when lion had lost his roar from a sickness that had hit all the carnivorous animals of the jungle. Whereas all the other animals escaped intact, lion was the only one who suffered greatly. It happened that crocodile was snapping at all the animals but lion could do nothing about it. One day flea told lion that if he dared to enter the great cave of the jungle, maybe he would find his roar. Lion plucked up the courage to confront the great cave and when he roared with all his might, an even bigger roar came back, his very own echo. He had found his roar! From that day on lion always roars with pride, showing any beast who's the real king of the jungle land.</p>
